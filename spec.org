     Each project will have its own Todo list. Multiple projects can be viewed at once

**** Calendar View

** Stage

   Stages are more nebulous than projects. They is not necessarily apparent in every view, but will be tied to every project nonetheless. 

   Stages contain:

   2. A Name
   3. A list of issues in the stage

   Stages can be anything from {todo, doing, done} to {math class, physics class, english class} and anywhere in between. They are meant to be flexible enough to fit different task management strategies.

*** View-specific functionality

**** Kanban View

     In kanban view, stages represent the lists, or columns, of the board. 

     The traditional kanban view uses different levels of completion for each stage, but stages can be adjusted to any categorization.

**** Todo View

     The priority level of each stage will dictate which items end up at the top of the list. Stages will be otherwise invisible in todo list mode.

**** Calendar View

     Stages will be visible in single-project calendar view only. 

     If one project is being viewed, different stages will have different colors. If multiple calendars are being viewed, the calendars will each be monochromatic, and stages will be essentially invisible.

** Issue

   Issues are the smallest component.

*** Issue state

**** Title for issue

     Title should be a short description of the project. Long limits are better.

**** Stage of the issue 

     Stages in the project will be displayed. The project will have a default stage, which will be auto-selected.

**** Description

     Description of the projects can have a wywiwyg editor in them.

**** Due Date

     Issues can be assigned for:
     1) A due day
     2) A due day and time
     3) A due time period (from x to y)

     Priority level can be set to one of three levels:
     1. now
     2. soon
     3. later
